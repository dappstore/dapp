# Dapp - A decentralized app store for go applications powered by IPFS and Stellar

 Dapp is a go library and associated command line utilities to develop go applications in which the publisher can publish and collect payment for their code.  Dapp aims to use best practices for deploying code to users, leveraging IPFS and Stellar to provide crypographic assurances about the published code.

Publishers can use the command line utilities to publish new releases, represented by an ipfs path. Push releases into channels by updating a manifest file.
